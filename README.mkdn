AOSGP
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the AOSGP trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/AOSGP/manifest.git -b L-7.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the [LineageOS Wiki](https://source.android.com/) for building instructions.
